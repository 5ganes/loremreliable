If you are uncertain as to your rights under these conditions, or you would like an explanation of any part of them, please contact us. You can also obtain your own legal advice on them, should you wish to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Placement and Location</strong><br />
It is a condition of your booking that you are prepared to be flexible in relation to your placement and its location If you are not happy with the placement offered or a suitable alternative cannot be offered, we will refund any monies you have paid us less the cost of any training you have received, and your deposit to cover our costs in processing your application and trying to find you a suitable alternative.</p>
<p>In order to process your application for a placement, you will be asked to provide a suitable reference and health check and/or criminal check. You/your doctor may also be asked to provide additional information on your health. We are also entitled to carry out a check on you with the Criminal Records Bureau (or any equivalent body). If in our opinion, or that of your Coordinator, the reference and/or health information and/or criminal check we receive about you or any other information you provide make you unsuitable for your chosen placement, we/your Coordinator are entitled to refuse to proceed further with your application. In these circumstances we will not refund your deposit in order to cover our costs in processing your application and trying to find you a placement. We honestly believe that all statements made in our brochure or website are factual and correct. Every reasonable effort has been made to describe the placement and to provide the amenities described. We cannot therefore be held responsible for any changes that become known after the brochure was produced (up-to-date information can be found on the website), nor can we accept liability for happenings outside our reasonable control. We undertake to advise you of any material changes known to us prior to your departure.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodation</strong><br />
Details of whether accommodation (if any) is provided as part of each placement are set out in the brochure, on the website or are available from us when you book.<br />
In placement accommodation, your sleeping arrangements may be private or shared, and in most cases you will be required to share a bathroom and toilet facilities. It is important for you to realize that bathroom and toilet facilities and standards of hygiene will be in accordance with local standards. These facilities and standards may sometimes be very basic.</p>

<p><strong>Travel</strong><br />
You are responsible for arranging and paying for your own travel (including your air fare) to the airport closest to your placement, and for your return journey at the end of your placement. We will not plan a program until you have sent us your flight details. We are unable to reimburse or otherwise be responsible for any flight, travel or other costs or expenses of any nature for example if your flight is cancelled.</p>
<p>Collection from the Airport<br />
On receipt of your flight details we will organize for you to be picked up from the airport to your accommodation in Kathmandu. This is covered in the cost of your volunteer fee and as such there will be no charge for this and we will endeavor to our very best to be on time. We can not be held accountable for problems such as vehicles breaking down but we will do our best to meet you punctually. Also please note that we are not allowed into the arrivals hall of the airport so we will meet you just outside with a name plate. The area is not big and it should be easy to find each other.</p>
<p><strong>Expenses</strong><br />
You are responsible for all of your personal expenses and for the cost of extra activities (paragliding, rafting, bunjee jump and trekking) incurred during the course of your program.  Daily transportation costs are the volunteers' responsibility, although we try to confirm accommodations within walking distance to work site or bus transportation (very cheap in each country).</p>
<p><strong>Travel Insurance</strong><br />
You will take out your own insurance cover for the period of your placement, you are responsible for ensuring that the amount and type of cover is sufficient and appropriate for the nature and location of your placement. You must provide us with a copy of your certificate of insurance as soon as possible. This insurance should at least cover; the cost of cancellation of the placement by you; the cost of assistance including repatriation in the event of accident or illness; legal liability and expenses; lost baggage; cancelled flights; medical expenses; kidnapping; liability arising due to personal injury to you or a third party; cancellation of your placement for any other reason including our liquidation or any other reason beyond our control.</p>
<p><strong>Passport &amp; Visas</strong><br />

You must ensure that you have a full passport, valid until at least 6 months after your planned return date. You are responsible for organizing your own visa. Nepal do not issue visas specifically for volunteers. Work permits are often difficult to obtain. Therefore HOPE and HOME advises volunteers to enter on tourist visas. Technically, you are not permitted to work on tourist visas, but because you are not undertaking paid work, it is tolerated. At the time of writing none of our volunteers, to our knowledge, had encountered any problems with immigration authorities at port of entry on this point.</p>
<p>Problems during your Placement<br />
You are responsible for trying to sort out any problems that may arise during your placement, however, in the event that you experience any difficulties, your Coordinator will be available and will do their best to assist you. He/she may also be able to provide practical help should you need to return to your country of abode before completion of your placement as a result of illness or other personal reason (although you are financially responsible for the costs of this, either under your insurance policy or otherwise). If it is imperative that you do leave your placement, for example due to serious medical problems, then we will either hold your money in credit until you can resume your placement for a period up to one calendar year or at the discretion of HOPE and HOME we may be able to refund you an appropriate amount, for example minus the training fees and administration costs.<br />
It is important to remember that your Coordinator will be available at limited times only and will be able to provide limited support. The nature of your placement is that you are able to show a high level of independence, flexibility and initiative in dealing with problems yourself as they arise. Your Coordinator will take all reasonable steps to arrange a safe placement with a consistent level of work throughout, but as neither we nor your Coordinator have any direct control over your placement we/your Coordinator cannot guarantee your level of work. You are responsible for taking every day common sense steps as an independent traveller to protect your safety on a day to day basis.</p>
<p><strong>Your Obligations</strong><br />
You must comply with any reasonable request by your placement or Coordinator. This may involve being transferred to a site in the locality provided that this would not place you in any danger and that the travel to the appropriate site is reasonable, or that suitable accommodation is provided. (You are responsible for any reasonable travel costs incurred in doing this). You must not enter into any direct negotiations or contractual arrangement for employment during your placement.<br />
You must take care of and be responsible for any materials provided for your use by your placement, You are responsible for any damage or loss you cause to such materials (directly or through neglect). You are responsible for any damage to your accommodation caused by you or any guest(s) of yours at your accommodation (directly or through neglect) You must behave appropriately in accordance with locally accepted behaviour and custom during your placement. We/your Coordinator do not accept responsibility for failure to secure work or dismissal from such work due to inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellations and Refunds</strong><br />
Once the volunteer makes a decision and pays for the , registration fee and program fee, upon receipt of invoice, HOPE and HOME: Volunteer Program does not refund any registration fee and program fee under any circumstances. S/he should be for that particular program. But if the volunteer have unavoidable circumstances (such as illness, death of in the family etc) may request to leave the program, HOPE and HOME: Volunteer Program will consider to return 25% of the host family cost, if volunteer are registered for more than 30 days program. No refund will be made if program is less than 30 days and if volunteer leave program in their own decision. volunteer position are non transferable.</p>

<p><strong>Program Dates</strong><br />
Dates of your program are agreed prior to training in Kathmandu. You may leave your placement early with agreement HOPE and HOME but no refund will be granted. You may extend your volunteer period at the discretion of and with prior agreement of HOPE and HOME provided monies for the extra months are paid in advance. When your placement is over you must leave your host family&#8217;s residence.</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong><br />
Where meals are provided, you should receive at least two meals a day throughout your training and placement, which will be of a suitable quality or quantity by local standards. If you wish to supplement your diet with other foods the responsibility of these expenses are yours. We will only cover food and accommodation for the period agreed for your placement and only at your placement and training. For example if you go trekking or wish to stay in Nepal after your agreed period of placement you will be responsible for your own expenses. If you decide to go away during your placement we cannot refund you any monies and you do this at your own cost.</p>
<p><strong>Code of conduct</strong></p>
<p>All participants on our programs are expected to adhere to proper conduct, listen to the instructions of your co-ordinator and the charities code of conduct. This covers, but is not limited to, respecting others' cultures and beliefs, working responsibly at your project, respecting the accommodation and avoiding drugs and illegal activities. Also participants will be removed from their program without a refund if they engage in illegal, violent or improper behaviour.</p>
